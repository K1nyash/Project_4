## 
The goal of this project is to conduct sentiment analysis since it allows businesses to quickly understand their customers' overall opinions..
# Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle



## Objectives
1. To identify accommodation attributes Airbnb guests use to rate their experience

2. To extract sentiments from unstructured customer review texts.

3. To build a word cloud with key word attributes customers use in their reviews.



## Procedure

1. Business Understanding: Discovering more about business reasons for our data mining effort and exploring what the company expects to gain from the project. By attempting to understand the objectives and requirements of the business, which in this case is Airbnb

2. Data Understanding: A brief overview of the data which involves accessing the data and exploring it using tables and graphics 

3. Data Preparation: Data is cleaned and prepared in a clean and organised standard format for further further analysis involving the following tasks; Merging data sets, selecting a sample subset of data, aggregating records, deriving new attributes, sorting the data for modelling, removing or replacing blank or missing values, tokenize, transform it into a Document-Term Matrix and finally splitting into training and test data sets. 

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: The goal of this process is to summarise the main characteristics of the dataset, often by using visual methods. Outputs of this procedure include Word clouds and top grams

4. Modelling: Models are built such as Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks to further support and provide insight to our previously posed questions.

5. Recommendation and Conclusion: Here, we interpret our project findings, provide opinions based on the project findings, and propose a solution, a gap in the research that requires further investigation, and the next step in research.
